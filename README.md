# Koha

An ERC20 Token unleashed into the polygon network. Has about enough supply for a small village. Can be radioactive☢️. Goes for 0.001 Matic per Token. Clinch some.

## Project

It comes with a `Koha.sol` contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. You would also see a `kohaTokenSale.sol` contract that handles the ICO side of things.
